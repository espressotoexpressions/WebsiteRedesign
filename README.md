- As a firefox user I am unable to view your images. Typically files should be formatted as "../folder/file.filetype"
- first and second sections of the hero images have duplicate content. I.E Keyboards & Pianos in products page
- in the history page there is a lot empty space at the start under the history text. in the figma this is not represented
- in the about page last area with the dog image. The figma representation of the image is different. It is about half the size and is cut off. Try making the site as close to 1-1 regarding the image
- In the contact page, the icons are not the same as the site's. Also, you may want to square off your input fields to better implement the figma verson

### Mobile Version

- Prodoct page. Immediately noticed the difference from figma and the mobile site. Please fix your hero as the image, text, and transparent block are significantly different from the figma
- All the text in the produck page doesn't resemble the figma's. Also one of the background colors for the text is different, pure white instead of the grey-ish color
-in the lessons page please fix the text as well. The text is either much smaller or much bigger in a noticable capacity when compared to the figma.
- text in the repair page is a lot light than the figma
- The set up for "Electric players" under the repair page needs some adjusting. The transparent box needs to be a bit lighter to get the image through a bit more.
-Rental page. The background color for the first body of text is differnt in both figma and site.
- for the accordion on the page, make sure to bold the header
- content layout in the accordion does not match the figma
- You bolded the headers in the accordion, but that isn't represented in the figma
- the about page is pretty spot on, but increase the font weight a bit and maybe the text size
- Figma has some overlap with icon and text.
