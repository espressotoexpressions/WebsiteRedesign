                <p class="grid-margin">
                    Now you can have great tone and volume by having a high quality pick up installed 
                    in your favorite acoustic guitar. This invisible installation will allow you to 
                    plug directly into any amp or P.A. system with no changes in acoustic performance. 
                    We recommend the LR Baggs I beam pickup and installation is free with a Minor Setup. 
                    At last, great tone without feedback!  We can also improve the tone quality and 
                    sustain of most acoustic guitars with the installation of a custom made saddle and 
                    nut. For acoustics we recommend bone as the material of choice. For electric 
                    acoustics we use bone, Corian or Mircarta as recommended by The Martin Co. These 
                    components along with a setup will insure that your guitar sounds and plays it’s 
                    best for a lifetime of enjoyment. Feel free to call if you have any questions.

                    We offer a full line of services for the electric guitar and bass players. With today’s newest features, locking nuts, floating tremolos and slim neck designs, proper setup is critical. Our Minor Set up insures that your guitar or bass will play it’s best and in tune over the entire fret board. For the ultimate in smooth, low action, our Major Set up will level and dress the entire fret board removing wear marks and grooves leaving the fret tops as smooth as glass for effortless bending. We also offer custom wiring for your guitar to release new sounds and textures from your existing pickups or install new ones to create the exact tonal response you desire. There’s nothing like a fret job to restore performance to an older guitar. We use a neck jig and hand press each fret to insure the frets seat properly with much less shock to your instrument and less chance of fret ends popping up.  We can handle any and all of your repair needs. Free consultations and estimates.
