        <p class="pt-2">Janis Music Co. was founded by Edward and Jeannette Janis in 1962. Ed grew up in White Plains NY and as a a young musician and big band leader he toured the east coast in the late 30's and forties. He was introduced to 16 yr. old Jeannette Bougeois by his brother George and she soon became lead singer for his band in Massachusetts. In 1942, the two married. Janis's moved west and eventually settled in Monterey California where Ed worked at American Can Co. on the famed Cannery Row by day and began working as a bass guitarist at the Casa Munras Club (which still operates today) at night. In 1949 the Sardine fishing industry began dying out and Cannery Row was experiencing a number of mysterious fires and Cannery closings. American Can Co. gave Ed an option to transfer to either Oakland or Stockton. Since the couple were both from small towns, they decided to live in Manteca. Some time later, Ed stopped working for American Can and started selling real estate for Antone Raymus. In 1962, the Janis's opened the first music store in Manteca. </p>
